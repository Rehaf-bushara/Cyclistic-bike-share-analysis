# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Analyze 12 months of Cyclistic trip data to understand **how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently** and support marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The original raw trip data is publicly available from [Divvy / Cyclistic System Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

Due to file size limits, the cleaned data couldnt be included in this repository.  
To reproduce the full analysis, download the raw data from the link above and run `cyclistic_case_study.ipynb`.

## ðŸ›  Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Power BI
- Excel

## ðŸ“Š Steps
1. Data cleaning & processing in Python.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Exported cleaned dataset for visualization.
4. Built interactive dashboard in Power BI.

## ðŸš² Key Insights
- Members take more consistent weekday rides, while casual riders use bikes more on weekends.
- Casual riders have longer average ride durations.
- Summer is the peak season for both groups.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `cyclistic_analysis.ipynb` â†’ Python notebook with cleaning & analysis.
- `cyclistic_cleaned.csv` â†’ Final cleaned dataset.
- `cyclistic_dashboard.pbix` â†’ Power BI dashboard.
- `README.md` â†’ Project description.

## âœ… Recommendations
1. Target weekend marketing campaigns at casual riders.
2. Emphasize cost savings of memberships for longer rides.
3. Focus digital ads near tourist-heavy start stations.
