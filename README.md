3. Exported cleaned dataset for visualization.
4. Built interactive dashboard in Power BI.

## ðŸš² Key Insights
- Members take more consistent weekday rides, while casual riders use bikes more on weekends.
- Casual riders have longer average ride durations.
- Summer is the peak season for both groups.
